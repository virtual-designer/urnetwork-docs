The API uses an authentication JWT. There are two roles of JWT: admin (user) and client. Admins have more privileges on the network. To get started with an admin JWT, [create a network on the website](https://ur.io/?auth). Then in the dialog, tap the button "Copy an Auth Code". This will copy a limited-time auth code to the clipboard. Use the following API request to convert the auth code into an admin JWT.
