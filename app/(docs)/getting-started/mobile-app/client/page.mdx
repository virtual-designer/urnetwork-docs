# Getting started with URnetwork client

URnetwork maintains native apps on macOS, Android 
and iOS.  We are working on getting apps ready for other
platforms as well.

### macOS/iOS

**App store link:** https://apps.apple.com/us/app/urnetwork/id6741000606<br />
You can use this link to install the app from the App Store.

### Android

**Play store link:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bringyour.network<br />
You can use this link to install the app.

<Callout type="info">
    In some cases, the app store / play store version of the app may lag behind, due to
    checks Google performs on each update.  If you want the latest version,
    you might want to download the necessary file manually from our 
    [GitHub releases](https://github.com/urnetwork/build/releases/latest) 
    and install it from there.
