# Providing to URnetwork

To provide your internet to URnetwork, you run a small provider application
on your system, which shares your internet with the network.  This application
is often referred to as the "provider binary" or "provider executable".

We maintain URnetwork provider binaries for many platforms and architectures,
including GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.  We'll give you a short guide on how
set them up on your system.

Here's a list of shortcut links to the platforms you might want to see instructions for:

* [GNU/Linux](#gnulinux)
* [macOS](#macos)
* [Windows](#windows)

## GNU/Linux

Run the following command:

```bash
curl -fSsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urnetwork/connect/refs/heads/main/scripts/Provider_Install_Linux.sh | sh
```

This command will install the latest URnetwork provider binary, and a small
helper tool called **urnet-tools**.

The installation script requires you have the following installed:

* [cURL](https://curl.se)
* Either [jq](https://jqlang.org) or [Python 3.8+](https://python.org)
* A POSIX-compatible shell

Most modern GNU/Linux systems already have these installed, so you usually
won't have to worry about them.  But if yours does not have these, or if you
use a very minimal system, you will have to consult your Distro's packaging
system to figure out how to install them.

After you run this script, you should follow the steps in the [post install instructions section](#post-install-instructions).

### Integration with [systemd](https://systemd.io)

On GNU/Linux systems, systemd is the preferred way to run URnetwork as a service.
URnetwork does not require superuser permissions to install, as a result,
we only install user-level services, which most other init systems do not support.
If you use some other init system than systemd, we expect that you have the ability
to create a service for the provider by yourself.

The installation script installs three units: `urnetwork.service`, `urnetwork-updater.service` and
`urnetwork-updater.timer`.  The `urnetwork.service` is the provider service unit.  You can manage
it just like any other systemd service.

```bash
systemctl --user start urnetwork           # Starts the provider
systemctl --user stop urnetwork            # Stops the provider
systemctl --user enable urnetwork          # Auto-starts the provider on login
systemctl --user disable urnetwork         # Disables auto-start on login
systemctl --user status urnetwork          # Shows the service status
```

The `urnetwork-updater` units are auto-update helpers, so that you don't have to manually update URnetwork. 
If you don't like auto-updates, running the following will disable it:

```bash
systemctl --user disable urnetwork-update.timer
```

<Callout type="warning">
    On many systems, logging in as root does not start the systemd user instance, which
    these commands require to operate.  As a result, these commands may fail when running as root.
    Therefore, we do not recommend running these services as root.
</Callout>

### Post-install instructions

The first thing to do after installation is to re-source your `~/.bashrc`. To do so, run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This will ensure urnetwork commands work from now on.

<Callout type="info">
    If you do not use bash as your default shell, the installer will create a `~/.bashrc` file,
    which you should open up and copy paste its contents into your shell's profile or `*rc` file accordingly.
</Callout>

To further verify that your installation was successful, run:

```bash
urnetwork --help
urnet-tools --help
```

Both of these commands should print out help instructions.

### Authentication

Next, you have to log into URnetwork. To do so, run:

```bash
urnetwork auth
```

Then:

1. It will ask for an auth code. You can obtain an auth code at https://ur.io.
2. If you aren't logged in there, you should log in first.  
3. Then at the top right corner of the site, you should see the name of your network.
4. Click on it, and it should open up a modal.  
5. In the modal, there should be a button to copy an auth code.  
6. Click on it, then paste the auth code in your terminal. Then hit enter.  

If your auth code was correctly copied, you should be logged into URnetwork now.  The command above saves your account
JWT token to `~/.urnetwork/jwt`. You should not share this with anyone.

### Starting the provider

Finally, you can start the provider:

```bash
systemctl --user start urnetwork
```

If everything was set up correctly, this will not produce any output. To see the status of
the service, run:

```bash
systemctl --user status urnetwork
```

This should show that the service is active and running. Congratulations, you are now a part of
URnetwork!

### Uninstalling

In case if you want to uninstall URnetwork, you can use `urnet-tools` for that:

```bash
urnet-tools uninstall
```

## macOS

To install the provider on a macOS device, you have two options,
either build the provider from source, or use a prebuilt binary.

As of now, there isn't an installer script for macOS users.  You will
have to download the provider release tarball manually and install the
provider from there.

Go to the releases page of [urnetwork/connect](https://github.com/urnetwork/connect/releases),
and download the tarball from there.  Then extract it.  The tarball should
contain a directory named `darwin`, which has the provider binaries for macOS.

Inside that, if you have an Intel Mac, you'll have to go into the `amd64` directory. Otherwise,
if you have an Apple Sillicon Chip, then you'll go inside the `arm64` directory.

You should see a file named `provider`, which is the provider executable.  You can copy it
to somewhere else, and run it like a CLI application in your terminal.

Next, to log into URnetwork, the instructions are similar to GNU/Linux.

```bash
<path_to_provider>/provider auth         # Be sure to replace <path_to_provider> with the actual path where the provider is!
```

Then:

1. It will ask for an auth code. You can obtain an auth code at https://ur.io.
2. If you aren't logged in there, you should log in first.  
3. Then at the top right corner of the site, you should see the name of your network.
4. Click on it, and it should open up a modal.  
5. In the modal, there should be a button to copy an auth code.  
6. Click on it, then paste the auth code in your terminal. Then hit enter.  

If your auth code was correctly copied, you should be logged into URnetwork now.  The command above saves your account
JWT token to `~/.urnetwork/jwt`. You should not share this with anyone.

Once that is done, you can start the provider by using the command:

```bash
<path_to_provider>/provider provide       # Be sure to replace <path_to_provider> with the actual path where the provider is!
```

## Windows

Todo.

## Building from source

If you want to build URnetwork from source, the first thing you need to do is Install Go. Head over to
https://go.dev/ and download a Go toolchain. Then, run the following commands (assuming GNU/Linux, macOS, BSD or similar UNIX-like systems):

```bash
mkdir urnetwork
cd urnetwork
git clone https://github.com/urnetwork/connect
git clone https://github.com/urnetwork/protocol
cd connect/provider
go build
# After this, the provider binary should be at ./provider
```
