# Providing to URnetwork

To provide your internet to URnetwork, you run a small provider application
on your system, which shares your internet with the network.  This application
is often referred to as the "provider binary" or "provider executable".

We maintain URnetwork provider binaries for many platforms and architectures,
including GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.  We'll give you a short guide on how
set them up on your system.

## Windows

Run the following command to install provider for linux as well as urnet-tools:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urnetwork/connect/refs/heads/main/scripts/Provider_Install_Win32.ps1 | iex"
```
<Callout type="warning">
    * Windows MAY flag URnetwork CLI as a virus, this is due to the program not being signed, it has nothing to do with an actual virus. The code is fully open source and scanned on virus total.

    * Windows MAY show an error when running the command such as: `urnet-tools.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.`
    
    * Don't worry, this can be fixed by opening Powershell as an admin and running: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` then typing `y` then enter to accept risk.
</Callout>


This command will install the latest URnetwork provider binary, and a small
helper tool called **urnet-tools**.

After you run this script, you should follow the steps in the [post install instructions section](#post-install-instructions).

### Post-install instructions

The first thing to do after installation is to restart your terminal (close it then open up a new one)

This will ensure urnetwork commands work from now on.

To further verify that your installation was successful, run:

```bash
urnetwork -help
urnet-tools -help
```
