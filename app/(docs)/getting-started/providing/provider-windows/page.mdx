# Providing to URnetwork

To provide your internet to URnetwork, you run a small provider application
on your system, which shares your internet with the network.  This application
is often referred to as the "provider binary" or "provider executable".

We maintain URnetwork provider binaries for many platforms and architectures,
including GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.  We'll give you a short guide on how
set them up on your system.

## Windows

Run the following command to install provider for linux as well as urnet-tools:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urnetwork/connect/refs/heads/main/scripts/Provider_Install_Win32.ps1 | iex"
```
