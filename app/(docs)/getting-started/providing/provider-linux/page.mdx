# Providing to URnetwork

Sharing your connection is easy: you just run a small 'provider' program on your system. This program acts as your gateway to the URnetwork.

URnetwork provider software is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. This guide will help you get it running on your Linux system in just a few minutes.

## GNU/Linux Setup

<Callout type="warning">
**Before you start**

Our installation script needs a few basic tools: **cURL**, **jq** (or Python 3.8+), and a standard terminal. 

Most systems have these already. If you are on a very "minimal" system and aren't sure, you can automatically install them by running our **[Install Helper script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urnetwork/connect/refs/heads/main/scripts/Provider_Install_Deps.sh)** as a root user, or just install **cURL** and **jq** via your system's package manager.
</Callout>

### 1. Installation

Run the following command to install the URnetwork provider and the **urnet-tools** helper:

```bash
curl -fSsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urnetwork/connect/refs/heads/main/scripts/Provider_Install_Linux.sh | sh
```

After you run this script, you should follow the steps in the [post install instructions section](#post-install-instructions).


### Post-install instructions

Once the installation is finished, your terminal needs to be "refreshed" so it recognizes the new `urnetwork` commands. To do this, run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

<Callout type="info">
   **Using something other than Bash?**
   Most Linux systems use a "shell" called **Bash**. If you use a different one (like **Zsh**), the installer will still create a `~/.bashrc` file for you. 
   
   If your commands aren't working, simply open that `~/.bashrc` file, copy the text inside, and paste it into your own shell's settings file (usually `~/.zshrc`).
</Callout>

To further verify that your installation was successful, run:

```bash
urnetwork --help
urnet-tools --help
```

Both of these commands should print out help instructions.

### Authentication

Next, you have to log into URnetwork. To do so, run:

```bash
urnetwork auth
```

When prompted, enter your **Auth Code**. Get one from https://ur.io, https://app.ur.network or inside the mobile app.
The auth code button should be located in the settings section of their respective app. 

Keep in mind that the auth code is time-sensitive and by default will expire after 5 minutes. Also, for security reasons, no characters will show up in the terminal when you type or paste the code. This is normal for Linux terminals, just like when you enter a password.

If your auth code was correctly copied, you should be logged into URnetwork now. The command above saves your account
JWT token to `~/.urnetwork/jwt`. You should not share this with anyone.

### Proxy Configuration (Optional)

If you need to use proxies with the binary app, use the following commands to manage them. URnetwork supports **SOCKS5** proxies.

#### Add Proxies
To add proxies from a file (format `ip:port:username:password`, one per line):
```bash
urnetwork proxy add --proxy_file=/home/username/proxy.txt
```

#### Remove Proxies
To remove all existing proxies:
```bash
urnetwork proxy remove --all
```

#### Apply Changes
After adding or removing proxies, you must restart the provider binary/service to apply the changes:
```bash
systemctl --user restart urnetwork
```

### Starting the provider

Finally, you can start the provider:

```bash
urnet-tools start
```

Or if you want to run it in the foreground for your own purposes:

```bash
urnetwork provide
```

Keep in mind if you close the terminal window while running in the foreground, the process will stop. It's recommended to use **urnet-tools** to create a service automatically.

It's also recommended to allow the service to start automatically on boot. Set & forget. 

Use the following to enable system startup:

```bash
urnet-tools auto-start on
```

This will enable the service; use `off` to turn startup off.

If everything was set up correctly, this will not produce any output. To see the status of
the service, run:

```bash
urnet-tools status
```

This should show that the service is active and running. Congratulations, you are now a part of
URnetwork!


### Updating

If you'd like to manually update, you can easily run:

```bash
urnet-tools update
```

This command also allows you to choose a build version; you can find the build tag [here](https://github.com/urnetwork/connect/releases).

If you prefer to not worry about it, you can set it to automatically update to the latest stable version using:

```bash
urnet-tools auto-update on
```

This will check for updates daily; use `off` to turn auto updates off.

### Uninstalling

In case you want to uninstall URnetwork, you can use `urnet-tools` for that:

```bash
urnet-tools uninstall
```

Or paste the official uninstaller script into your terminal:

```bash
curl -fSsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urnetwork/connect/refs/heads/main/scripts/Provider_Uninstall_Linux.sh | sh
```
