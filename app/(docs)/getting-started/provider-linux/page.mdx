# Providing to URnetwork

To provide your internet to URnetwork, you run a small provider application
on your system, which shares your internet with the network.  This application
is often referred to as the "provider binary" or "provider executable".

We maintain URnetwork provider binaries for many platforms and architectures,
including GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.  We'll give you a short guide on how
set them up on your system.

Here's a list of shortcut links to the platforms you might want to see instructions for:

* [GNU/Linux](#gnulinux)
* [macOS](#macos)
* [Windows](#windows)

## GNU/Linux

Run the following command:

```bash
curl -fSsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urnetwork/connect/refs/heads/main/scripts/Provider_Install_Linux.sh | sh
```

This command will install the latest URnetwork provider binary, and a small
helper tool called **urnet-tools**.

The installation script requires you have the following installed:

```bash
curl -fSsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urnetwork/connect/refs/heads/main/scripts/Provider_Install_Deps.sh | sh
```


* [cURL](https://curl.se)
* Either [jq](https://jqlang.org) or [Python 3.8+](https://python.org)
* A POSIX-compatible shell

Most modern GNU/Linux systems already have these installed, so you usually
won't have to worry about them.  But if yours does not have these, or if you
use a very minimal system, you will have to consult your Distro's packaging
system to figure out how to install them.

After you run this script, you should follow the steps in the [post install instructions section](#post-install-instructions).


### Post-install instructions

The first thing to do after installation is to re-source your `~/.bashrc`. To do so, run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This will ensure urnetwork commands work from now on.

<Callout type="info">
    If you do not use bash as your default shell, the installer will create a `~/.bashrc` file,
    which you should open up and copy paste its contents into your shell's profile or `*rc` file accordingly.
</Callout>

To further verify that your installation was successful, run:

```bash
urnetwork --help
urnet-tools --help
```

Both of these commands should print out help instructions.

### Authentication

Next, you have to log into URnetwork. To do so, run:

```bash
urnetwork auth
```

Then:

1. It will ask for an auth code. You can obtain an auth code at https://ur.io.
2. If you aren't logged in there, you should log in first.  
3. Then at the top right corner of the site, you should see the name of your network.
4. Click on it, and it should open up a modal.  
5. In the modal, there should be a button to copy an auth code.  
6. Click on it, then paste the auth code in your terminal. Then hit enter.  

If your auth code was correctly copied, you should be logged into URnetwork now.  The command above saves your account
JWT token to `~/.urnetwork/jwt`. You should not share this with anyone.

### Starting the provider

Finally, you can start the provider:

```bash
systemctl --user start urnetwork
```

If everything was set up correctly, this will not produce any output. To see the status of
the service, run:

```bash
systemctl --user status urnetwork
```

This should show that the service is active and running. Congratulations, you are now a part of
URnetwork!

### Uninstalling

In case if you want to uninstall URnetwork, you can use `urnet-tools` for that:

```bash
urnet-tools uninstall
```
