## macOS

To install the provider on a macOS device, you have two options,
either build the provider from source, or use a prebuilt binary.

As of now, there isn't an installer script for macOS users.  You will
have to download the provider release tarball manually and install the
provider from there.

Go to the releases page of [urnetwork/connect](https://github.com/urnetwork/connect/releases),
and download the tarball from there.  Then extract it.  The tarball should
contain a directory named `darwin`, which has the provider binaries for macOS.

Inside that, if you have an Intel Mac, you'll have to go into the `amd64` directory. Otherwise,
if you have an Apple Sillicon Chip, then you'll go inside the `arm64` directory.

You should see a file named `provider`, which is the provider executable.  You can copy it
to somewhere else, and run it like a CLI application in your terminal.

Next, to log into URnetwork, the instructions are similar to GNU/Linux.

```bash
<path_to_provider>/provider auth         # Be sure to replace <path_to_provider> with the actual path where the provider is!
```

Then:

1. It will ask for an auth code. You can obtain an auth code at https://ur.io.
2. If you aren't logged in there, you should log in first.  
3. Then at the top right corner of the site, you should see the name of your network.
4. Click on it, and it should open up a modal.  
5. In the modal, there should be a button to copy an auth code.  
6. Click on it, then paste the auth code in your terminal. Then hit enter.  

If your auth code was correctly copied, you should be logged into URnetwork now.  The command above saves your account
JWT token to `~/.urnetwork/jwt`. You should not share this with anyone.

Once that is done, you can start the provider by using the command:

```bash
<path_to_provider>/provider provide       # Be sure to replace <path_to_provider> with the actual path where the provider is!
```
