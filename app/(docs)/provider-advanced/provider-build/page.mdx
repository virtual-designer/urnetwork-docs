## Building from source

If you want to build URnetwork from source, the first thing you need to do is Install Go. Head over to
https://go.dev/ and download a Go toolchain. Then, run the following commands (assuming GNU/Linux, macOS, BSD or similar UNIX-like systems):

```bash
mkdir urnetwork
cd urnetwork
git clone https://github.com/urnetwork/connect
git clone https://github.com/urnetwork/protocol
cd connect/provider
go build
# After this, the provider binary should be at ./provider
```
