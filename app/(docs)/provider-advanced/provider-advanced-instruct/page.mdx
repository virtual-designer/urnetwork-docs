### Integration with [systemd](https://systemd.io)

On GNU/Linux systems, systemd is the preferred way to run URnetwork as a service.
URnetwork does not require superuser permissions to install, as a result,
we only install user-level services, which most other init systems do not support.
If you use some other init system than systemd, we expect that you have the ability
to create a service for the provider by yourself.

The installation script installs three units: `urnetwork.service`, `urnetwork-updater.service` and
`urnetwork-updater.timer`.  The `urnetwork.service` is the provider service unit.  You can manage
it just like any other systemd service.

```bash
systemctl --user start urnetwork           # Starts the provider
systemctl --user stop urnetwork            # Stops the provider
systemctl --user enable urnetwork          # Auto-starts the provider on login
systemctl --user disable urnetwork         # Disables auto-start on login
systemctl --user status urnetwork          # Shows the service status
```

The `urnetwork-updater` units are auto-update helpers, so that you don't have to manually update URnetwork. 
If you don't like auto-updates, running the following will disable it:

```bash
systemctl --user disable urnetwork-update.timer
```

<Callout type="warning">
    On many systems, logging in as root does not start the systemd user instance, which
    these commands require to operate.  As a result, these commands may fail when running as root.
    Therefore, we do not recommend running these services as root.
