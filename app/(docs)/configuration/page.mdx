# Configuration

There are a few configuration files in the `config/` directory of the project that you should be aware of. These configuration files make it easy for you
to customize the app without having to change a lot of source files directly.

At the moment, there are two major configuration files:

* [`config.ts`](/configuration/config) - General app level configuration parameters
* [`links.ts`](/configuration/links) - Links visible in the app and configuration related to that

Every time you edit the configuration files, you should also run the initialization script so that specific files are copied/moved to the correct locations according to your
configuration.

```bash
node scripts/init.ts
```
